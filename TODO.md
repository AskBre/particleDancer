Make force area exponential
Better, flatter sound analyzing
Performance tuning (multithread?)
Enable dynamic setting of forcefields (position)

What about a method for analyzing which is based on difference from previous sample/second/whatever rather than actual volume (a relative one)
Need some development/narrative. Maybe start with all of them, but when silent for several seconds they all disappear â€” when sound then comes back they slowly reappear
Base the reapperance on position of force-fields.
More organic somehow! Change size, make creatures (creatures towards the end, or something?), colour, shaders
